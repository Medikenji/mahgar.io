# Project Plan: "maghar"

_Maghar will be made with c++ raylib_
Maghar is a simplified singleplayer only version of agar.io.
You start as a tiny ball that can move on the x and y axis. If you pick up other balls (these can be npc's or pickups) you grow a bit. You do this until you get eaten by a bigger ball which ends the game.
I will first try and make these simple functions work and then I will see if I can add more functions.
